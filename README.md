# studio-ghibli-extender

This project is meant to extend (add additional functionality) to the [Studio Ghibli API](https://ghibliapi.herokuapp.com/).

Features added:
- Sort films by field for example year, runtime, rotten-tomatoes rating for example `/sort?field=rt_score&order=1`
- see the total time it would take to binge all movies (`/binge-time`)
